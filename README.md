# /mlptf2/ Maps
Source .VMFs of all maps made for the /mlp/ TF2 server.

## Requirements

These maps make use of custom assets, mostly Stefano's V4 Enhanced pony models, which you can find here:
* [Main Pack (Required)](https://www.deviantart.com/stefano96/art/DL-Enhanced-female-ponies-649617182)
* [2nd Pack](https://www.deviantart.com/stefano96/art/DL-Enhanced-Ponies-2nd-pack-664578914)
* [3rd Pack](https://www.deviantart.com/stefano96/art/DL-Enhanced-Ponies-3rd-pack-668723031)

* [Animation Presets (required)](https://www.deviantart.com/stefano96/art/DL-The-Puppet-Master-source-files-723722128)

Some maps use custom textures, notably the Legends of Equestria TF2 mix textures, debuted in cp_marebowl and now in use in pl_marewater_b6. These can be found in the [tf/materials/loetf](https://github.com/WapaMario63/-mlptf2-Maps/tree/main/tf/materials/loetf) directory of this repository.

Other assets include the textures inside koth_appleacres, you can rip them using GCFScape from the BSP itself. If some maps use its own map specific models, they will be listed.

### pl_sugarcube
* Creator: WapaMario63
* Current State: Initial Layout

_On Hold_

Payload map about a cake heist done by Rainbow Dash where BLU must deliver a huge cake from Sugarcube Corner to her cloud home near Fluttershy's Cottage, RED has to stop them.

### koth_ponyville_revamped
* Creator: WapaMario63
* Current Stage: Layout

This is a remake from the ground up of koth_ponyville_b4 (by Aly and Frozen from [mlptf2mods.com](http://mlptf2mods.com/mods/maps_king_of_the_hill/koth_ponyville) ), a map that is almost a decade old and is impossible to make changes to, mainly to improve performance and fix exploits, due to it being too detailed for it to be recompiled.
