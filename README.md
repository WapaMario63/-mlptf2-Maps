Some maps use custom textures, notably the Legends of Equestria TF2 mix textures, debuted in cp_marebowl and now in use in pl_marewater_b6. These can be found in the [tf/materials/loetf](https://github.com/WapaMario63/-mlptf2-Maps/tree/main/tf/materials/loetf) directory of this repository.

Other assets include the textures inside koth_appleacres, you can rip them using GCFScape from the BSP itself. If some maps use its own map specific models, they will be listed.
