## Maps in Development

### pl_sugarcube
* Creator: WapaMario63
* Current Stage: Initial Layout

_On Hold_

Payload map about a cake heist done by Rainbow Dash where BLU must deliver a huge cake from Sugarcube Corner to her cloud home near Fluttershy's Cottage, RED has to stop them.

### koth_ponyville_revamped
* Creator: WapaMario63
* Current Stage: Layout

This is a remake from the ground up of koth_ponyville_b4 (by Aly and Frozen from [mlptf2mods.com](http://mlptf2mods.com/mods/maps_king_of_the_hill/koth_ponyville) ), a map that is almost a decade old and is impossible to make changes to, mainly to improve performance and fix exploits, due to it being too detailed for it to be recompiled.
